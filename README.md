# Deploy Flask Application with PostgreSQL via Azure Container Apps

This project deploys a web application for a space travel agency using Flask. The application can be deployed to Azure with Azure App Service using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview).

## Opening the project

This project has [Dev Container support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), so it will be be setup automatically if you open it in Github Codespaces or in local VS Code with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

If you're not using one of those options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) and activate it.

1. Install production requirements:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    ```


1. Install the app as an editable package:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install -e src
    ```


1. Apply database migrations and seed initial data:

    ```sh
    python3 -m flask --app src.flaskapp db upgrade --directory src/flaskapp/migrations
    python3 -m flask --app src.flaskapp seed --filename src/seed_data.json
    ```

## Running locally

Run gunicorn on the app:

```sh
python3 -m gunicorn 'src.flaskapp:create_app()' -c src/gunicorn.conf.py
```

## Running tests

2. Install the development requirements:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.in
    playwright install --with-deps
    ```

3. Run the tests:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pytest
    ```

## Deployment

This repo is set up for deployment on Azure via Azure App Service.

Steps for deployment:

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure Subscription.
2. Install the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). (If you open this repository in Codespaces or with the VS Code Dev Containers extension, that part will be done for you.)
3. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

4. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "myapp"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location (like "eastus"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for some of the resources.

5. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the front page of the app! ðŸŽ‰

6. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```

### CI/CD pipeline

This project includes a Github workflow for deploying the resources to Azure
on every push to main. That workflow requires several Azure-related authentication secrets
to be stored as Github action secrets. To set that up, run:

```shell
azd pipeline config
```
